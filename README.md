## About Me

**My name is Jonathan Dunn.**\
**I'm currently a student and worker at Boise State University.**

### School

I study *Computer Science* and I hope to enter into the *digital security* field one day.\
I would love to say that I do it for the fun of it and the ability to further the power\
of our nation's digital security. But let's be real... **I do it for the _money_.** 💰

... of course I'm only kidding! Well... kinda. Although I do hope to make many major\
advancements in the field!

### Work

Currently, I work at $\color{#0033A0}{**B**}$$\color{#D64309}{**S**}$$\color{#0033A0}{**U**}$**<ins>BSU</ins>** as a supervisor for the West team for our custodial and maintenance teams.\
I help supervise our teams to try and bring a clean campus to students and staff for a more\
comfortable learning/working environment.

*It also gives a pretty sweet discount on tuition and credit costs too!*

### Hobbies

Gaming 🎮 , Drawing 🎨 , Programming 💻 , Farmer's Markets 👨‍🌾 , Hiking ⛰️
